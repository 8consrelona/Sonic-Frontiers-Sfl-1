# Sonic Frontiers Sfl-1
 
 
Sonic Frontiers is a large company in terms of factory size, employees and sales figures - at least by High End Audio standards. No, not the largest company in any of these three areas, but they are large enough to be considered a formidable force in the high end audio scene. This is no small feat considering that the company was born about ten years ago as, quite literally, a basement run, parts supplying operation with sales in the low tens of thousands of dollars. From those small beginnings they have grown to become one of the industry's key manufacturers, specializing in tube-based, audio electronics.

Sonic Frontiers was originally owned and run by Chris Johnson and John Sloan. Their business was dedicated to providing high grade component parts for audio Do-It-Yourselfers. Chris proudly proclaims that, *yes*, his mother was their first employee...but that was a long time ago - 1988 to be exact. During this infancy period, Chris also worked for a year or so as an IBM Sales Rep for their AS/400 mini-computers - he was a *blue suit,*so to speak. However, the entrepreneur inside got the best of him and he decided it was time to go full-time with the fledgling company he started. His gamble paid off. Sonic Frontiers grew in all directions and took a giant leap from being a basement operation into a small business with employees and an office. Success was on the horizon.
 
In 1989, Chris and John decided it was time to go beyond parts, so they began creating kits for Do-It-Yourself audio enthusiasts. Since there were no major kit manufacturers based in North America at the time, it looked like a niche worth exploiting. Their first product was a Joe Curcio designed mono amplifier that they dubbed the Sonic Frontiers SFM-75. Though somewhat industrial in appearance, the SFM-75 was an instant hit due to thoughtful design, high quality parts and attractive pricing. Chris is still proud of what the SFM-75 offered, even by today's standards.
 
With parts and kits providing at least decent revenue, Chris and John decided that it was time to go beyond kits and into full OEM component production of their own. By building on the design of the SFM-75, they produced the SFM-75 mk. II amplifier. Despite the similar foundation, the older SFM-75 kit bore only a passing resemblance to the stainless steel and aluminum clad SFM-75 mk.II. The product was introduced at WCES 91 and once again they had a hit single on their hands - it was time for more products.

Soon after the SFM-75 mk.II came the SFS-50 stereo amplifier. However, it was their SFL-1 preamplifier that put them on the map. The SFL-1 was again inspired by a Joe Curcio design. At its introductory price of $1295 US, the SFL-1 became a benchmark for performance and quality in its price range. Pretty soon the SFM-75 and SFS-50 were out of the line up and the SFS-40, SFS-80, and SFM-160 amplifiers were introduced. The SFL-1 stayed around, garnered more rave reviews (Doug Schneider got excited and bought one) and gave birth to an SFL-1 Signature with even more impressive parts quality and a higher price tag. The use of high quality parts had become synonymous with the Sonic Frontiers name -- not surprising given the company's beginnings.
 
In 1991, Chris Jensen entered the picture as Vice President of Marketing. Chris and Chris were both friends and Commerce graduates from The University of Toronto -- now they were business partners. Many in the industry will attest to the fact that they could not have picked a better way to confuse people than by the similarity of names. "I know I was talking to one of them but I can't remeber which one" and "there are two, right?" are some of the comments we've heard over the years.
 
Despite being a Canadian company, in the early 90s they found that a large part of their business was in the Far East. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are still their top three, non North America markets to this day. Their business took off in North America in 1993 when they released the SFL-2 preamplifier. Where Sonic had previously produced high performing products at a relatively low price point, this was their first attempt at "cost-no-object" performance. This is usually the point at which many companies fail -- they succeeded. *Stereophile*dubbed the SFL-2 a "Class A" Recommended Component and that was that.
 
Seeing the rapid developments in high end digital, they next set their eyes on the big players of the day. Contrary to the strategy used for their preamplifiers, they decided to try to build their best first - a formidable challenge considering Theta, Wadia and Krell had a good head start and a barrage of fine players. Furthermore, Madrigal had the much heralded No. 30 DAC which was being touted as simply the best. Being the shrewd businessmen that the Chris squared are, they decided not to go into the bit-wars alone, so they employed the top-notch digital engineering help of Ultra Analog. Sonic struck gold again when they released the SFD-2 digital processor. No, it was not necessarily the best to everyone - but it garnered enough universal praise to be considered a top contender. Again *Stereophile* pronounced the result "Class A" and Sonic Frontiers was on the road to becoming one of *the* high end audio manufacturers, playing second fiddle to no one. Other products followed. With the success of the manufactured products one area did fall by the wayside  the DIY products - but as you will see, they now have a plan for that too.
 
Today, Chris Johnson remains as company President and Chris Jensen the Vice President of Marketing. John Sloan left the company in 1995. As a result, Chris and Chris are the only two shareholders of the firm and the company's sales revenues are now in the many millions. Sonic Frontiers is presently located about 20 minutues west of downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada in a large 22,000 square foot complex. The building allots about 4,000 square feet for office space and the rest for manufacturing and warehousing. In all, they directly employ about 65 people.
 
After a number of break neck corners and stomach churning turns, sure enough John found his way to the end of a dead-end street  on the right was the large brown building with one lone Sonic Frontiers sign out front. We had arrived.
 
We stepped into the smallish entrance/waiting room and were assured that, "*Chris would be right with us*." As we sat in the waiting room we peered in amazement at the number of awards, plaques and displays of recognition from the audio press that hung proudly on their walls. "They sure have done a lot," Doug muttered. Chris Johnson arrived lickety split, led us through the maze of tightly spaced offices and took us into the boardroom to give us a lowdown on the Sonic Frontiers past, present and future. It was an interesting conversation mainly because of Chris Johnson's candor. He is a frank, down to earth person who is open about the company's goals with their products and where he thinks Sonic Frontiers fits into the high end marketplace. We also learned later (later, over lunch) that he feels, like us, that one of the main problems with high end audio is that it's "*too expensive*" - plain and simple. Despite owning a large high end audio company that does sell some very expensive products, Chris is a regular guy at heart. His rational thinking is something that helps guide the Sonic Frontiers product strategy.
 
Chris first talked to us about their product design goals. Among many things, we found out that despite the current trends they do not build any single-ended amplifiers, and don't plan to - at least in the Sonic Frontiers and Anthem line. Chris cites incompatibilities with many speakers (i.e. difficulty driving tougher loads) and poor technical performance as a couple of the reasons. "*We dont believe a single ended amp is much more than a haphazard tone control*," says Chris. A design goal of Sonic Frontiers is to produce amplifiers that will work flawlessly in the widest ranges of systems. Singled ended, he feels feel, doesn't cut it in that regard.
 
He went on to explain that all Sonic Frontiers amps are measured wide band (i.e. 20 Hz to 20 kHz) and achieve *at least* their full power ratings. Many of the single ended (and other tube amps for that matter), he says, are measured across a smaller window or allow much higher distortion figures in the specs. Chris doesn't deny that some of the single ended amps do sound good with the right speakers, he just feels that Sonic Frontiers can get fabulous results by putting great efforts into top notch engineering.
 
It was at this point that we nailed him with, *"does a designer have to be an audiophile?"*Chris responded that although being an audiophile doesn't hurt, first rate engineering skills are what's the most important and that's the focus at Sonic Frontiers. Chris classifies himself as a "recovering audiophile."
 
As for future products, Chris indicated they are looking into "*analogous activities*." Seeing the confused look on our faces he resorted to plain English  *home theater*. Only two days before the tour, it had dawned on us  Sonic Frontiers produces no home theater products! With this startling revelation from the Presidential mouth, things may change in tubeland. Chris said that they have been watching the market, evaluating how well companies were doing and ultimately deciding what products they would offer. When we asked, *"has anyone ever produced a 3 channel tube amplifier?"*Chris responded that it would be solid state if they did it! "Gasp," went Doug, "Sonic Frontiers offering solid state!" It does make more sense on the home theater side where high power is mandatory and musical refinement becomes secondary. Fear not, music lovers, Sonic Frontiers is committed to tubes for two channel, high end audio.
 
Sonic Frontiers manufactures the Anthem brand of components -- "best within boundaries" their literature proclaims. Chris sees the Anthem line applicable to budget audiophiles or those assembling a second system. The lineup includes the Pre 1L and Pre 1 preamplifiers (the 1L is linestage only and the 1 has a phono stage), the Integrated 1 rated at 25 watts per channel with optional phono stage available, the Amp 1 - 40 watt stereo power amp, and CD 1 cd player with HDCD. Chris was quick to point out that although these are their *entry level* products, there is *trickle down* technology from the Sonic Frontiers product line. Subsequently, these products are designed to beat out competitor's product anywhere near their price (of course, that's the goal of all manufacturers). Chris feels that a complete Anthem system with appropriately matched speakers and cables can be had for a hair under $5,000. He even mentioned that they toyed with the idea of selling a complete system by bundling their products with speakers and cables from other manufacturers. They ditched the idea since they know that audiophiles like to mix and match their components. As well, this all-in-the-box system may not fit in well with their dealers' product mix. Chris noted one new addition to the Anthem lineup - a separate phono stage for about $795 ("*right on,"*we whispered among ourselves).
